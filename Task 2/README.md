# 📊 Superstore Sales & Profit Analysis — Storytelling Dashboard

## 🎯 Objective
This project focuses on visual storytelling using sales data from a fictional retail store (Superstore).  
The goal is to explore whether **high sales always mean high profits**, and uncover which sub-categories are truly driving business success.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Dataset: [Superstore.csv](./dataset/Superstore.csv)

---

## 📈 Dashboard Summary

The dashboard includes:
- **KPI Cards** showing Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin
- **Clustered Column Chart** comparing Sales and Profit across Sub-Categories
- **Scatter Plot** showing the relationship between Sales and Profit
- **Interactive Slicers** to filter by Region (and optionally Category/Segment)

Due to layout constraints, insights are written here instead of on the dashboard.

## 📌 Key Insights & Business Story

- 📊 **Phones and Chairs** are the top-performing sub-categories in both Sales and Profit, indicating strong market demand and healthy margins.
- ⚠️ **Tables and Bookcases** show **high sales but negative or low profit**, suggesting potential pricing or cost issues.
- 📉 Categories like **Fasteners, Labels, and Envelopes** contribute little to overall sales/profit — candidates for reduced focus.
- 🌍 Regional filters reveal varying profitability. Some regions are driven by a few strong categories.
- 🧠 The **scatter plot** confirms that **high sales don’t always translate to high profit** — valuable for decision-makers.
