TASK 8: SALES DASHBOARD INSIGHTS
=========================================

DASHBOARD OVERVIEW:
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 9,994 sales records from 2014-2017
showing sales performance by product category, region, and time periods.

KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED:
=========================

1. üî• MASSIVE PROFITABILITY GAP BY CATEGORY:
   - Technology products: 17.4% profit margin (EXCELLENT)
   - Office Supplies: 17.0% profit margin (GOOD) 
   - Furniture: 2.5% profit margin (CRITICAL ISSUE)
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT: Company should prioritize Technology and Office Supplies over Furniture.
   Furniture strategy needs complete overhaul - barely profitable.

2. üö® DISCOUNT STRATEGY IS DESTROYING PROFITS:
   - Low discounts (0-10%): +28.89% profit margin ‚úÖ
   - Medium discounts (10-30%): +9.09% profit margin ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - High discounts (30-50%): -24.80% profit margin ‚ùå (LOSING MONEY!)
   - Very high discounts (50%+): -119.20% profit margin üíÄ (DISASTER!)
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT: Discounts over 30% are literally losing money on every sale.
   Discount policy needs immediate revision.

3. üåç REGIONAL PERFORMANCE VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY:
   - East Region: Highest profit margins (~14.9%) despite moderate sales volume
   - West Region: Highest sales volume ($725K) but lower profit efficiency
   - Central & South: Underperforming in both sales and profitability
   
   BUSINESS IMPACT: East region's strategies should be replicated in other regions.
   West region has volume but needs profit optimization.

   - Monthly sales trend shows consistent growth from 2014-2017
   - Visible seasonal peaks and dips enable better inventory planning
